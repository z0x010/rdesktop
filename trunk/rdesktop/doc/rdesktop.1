.SH SYNOPSIS
.B rdesktop [options] server[:port]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I rdesktop
is a client for Microsoft Windows NT Terminal Server, Windows 2000 Terminal
Services, Windows XP Remote Desktop, and possibly other Terminal Services
products.  rdesktop currently implements the RDP version 4 protocol.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR "-u <username>"
Username for authentication on the terminal server.
.TP
.BR "-d <domain>"
Domain for authentication.
.TP
.BR "-s <shell>"
Startup shell for the user - starts a specific application instead of Explorer.
.TP
.BR "-c <directory>"
The initial working directory for the user.  Often used in combination with -s
to set up a fixed login environment.
.TP
.BR "-p <password>"
The password to authenticate with.  Note that this may have no effect if
"Always prompt for password" is enabled on the server.  WARNING: if you specify
a password on the command line it may be visible to other users when they use
tools like ps.  Use -p - to make rdesktop request a password at startup (from
standard input).
.TP
.BR "-n <hostname>"
Client hostname.  Normally rdesktop automatically obtains the hostname of the
client.
.TP
.BR "-k <layout>"
Keyboard layout on terminal server (us,sv,gr,etc.).  This requires a
corresponding keymap file to be installed (normally the keymaps are found in
/usr/share/rdesktop/keymaps/ or /usr/local/share/rdesktop/keymaps/).
.TP
.BR "-g <geometry>"
Desktop geometry (WxH). 
.TP
.BR "-f"
Enable fullscreen mode.  This overrides the window manager and causes the
rdesktop window to fully cover the current screen.  Fullscreen mode can be
toggled at any time using Ctrl-Alt-Break.
.TP
.BR "-b"
Force the server to send screen updates as bitmaps rather than using
higher-level drawing operations.
.TP
.BR "-m"
Do not send mouse motion events.  This saves bandwidth, although some Windows
applications may rely on receiving mouse motion.
.TP
.BR "-e"
Disable encryption.  This option is only needed (and will only work) if you
have a French version of NT TSE.
.TP
.BR "-K"
Do not override window manager key bindings.  By default rdesktop attempts
to grab all keyboard input when it is in focus.
.TP
.BR "-T <title>"
Window title.
