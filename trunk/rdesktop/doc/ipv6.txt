IPv6 support in rdesktop
========================
The IPv6 support was developed by Mike Dawson <mike@dexy.mine.nu>:

    Attached is a patch to tcp.c to enable IPv6 support.  Build with
    'IPv6' defined to enable it.  It's so far only been tested on
    Linux 2.4.21 connecting to Windows XP SP1.
    
    Since terminal services doesn't seem to bind to the ipv6 interface
    on XP I had to run 'netsh interface portproxy add v6tov4
    listenport=3389 connectport=33 89' from the windows command prompt
    to get it to work.
    
    One problem is that numeric ipv6 addresses on the command line
    don't work as they conflict with the host:port format for
    specifying host names.  Fixes for this I can think of include:
    
    * have a -6 switch for enabling ipv6 support
    * change the host:port format to 'host -P port' or something
    * more complicated parsing of the given host/address
