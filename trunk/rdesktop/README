rdesktop is an open source client for Windows NT Terminal Server and
Windows 2000 Terminal Services, capable of natively speaking Remote
Desktop Protocol (RDP) in order to present the user's NT
desktop. Unlike Citrix ICA, no server extensions are required.

rdesktop currently runs on most UNIX based platforms with the X Window
System, and other ports should be fairly straightforward.

rdesktop was written by Matt Chapman (matthewc@cse.unsw.edu.au) based
on various scarce documentation, wire sniffs, and trial-and-error. It
is released under the GNU Public Licence (GPL).  Please send feedback,
bug reports and patches to the appropriate mailing list
(http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=24366)

rdesktop is a Sourceforge project.  See the Sourceforge rdesktop
project info (http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdesktop/) for more
information.
