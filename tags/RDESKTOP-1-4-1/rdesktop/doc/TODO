* Clipboard:

  * Support other data types than plain text. 
 
  * Conversion between different character sets. 


* Drive Redirection:

  * Real support for file locking

  * Handle reconnections correctly. 

  * Various deficiencies; see FIXMEs in source code. 


* Serial Port Redirection:

  * More testing needed. 


* Printer Redirection:

  * More testing needed. 


* Keymapping: 

  * Support non-dead versions of some dead keys, like
    "acute". It seems like RDP4 only supports the dead versions, but
    the non-dead ones can be simulated by sending a space after the
    dead key.

  * Autodetect which keymap to use.


* Sound redirection

  * Use timestamps in audio packets.

  * Add resampling to supported samplerates of audio-hardware.

  * Lower CPU-usage with an audio thread.


* Smartcard redirection

  * Merge patches currently implementing sc-redirection.


* Miscellaneous

  * Clean up header files. The current "proto.h" and "xproto.h" is far
    from optimal.

  * Go through the many trackers (bugs/patches/RFEs) at SourceForge. 

  * More fancy homepage. 

  * Enhance documentation. Write a FAQ.
